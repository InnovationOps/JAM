    Brightidea API is a RESTful interface to features provided by Brightidea web application. Prior to making any requests, read the list below on requirements and behaviors:
    
      - Authentication is required prior to making API requests for most cases. See Authentication for information on the process.
      - To make a request, Access Token and Host Name are the two basic components needed.
      - All requests must be encryptedand use HTTPS protocol
      - Response is in JSON. You have the option to receive in XML by passing the proper parameter on each request.
      - All timestamps included in responses are in Eastern Standard Time.
      - All requests are subject to rate limiting. Exceeding any rate limits will result in error response. 
      - All parameter value must be URL encoded.
      
        
      Request content type:
      
      
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    

    There are a few basic url structures to Brightidea API requests:
    
      - https://{host_name}/api3/{object}
      - https://{host_name}/api3/{object}/{id}
      - https://{host_name}/api3/widget/{object}
    
    Access Token: 
      
      A valid access token must be present for most cases. Access token is obtained at the end of the Authentication process. There 2 ways access token can be passed in the API request.
      
      Example:
      
        MyOrg.brightidea.com
      

    Header:
      
      When access token is passed in header, it must use the attribute name "Authorization". Value must be prefixed with the string "Bearer", follow by a space, then the token value
        
      Example:
        
        Authorization=Bearer 85f7b2462570acdde9a458ba6495b8763dcd040c.
        
    
      
      When passed as a POST or GET parameter, it must use the attribute name "access_token". Value is the token string. 
        
      Example:
      
        access_token=85f7b2462570acdde9a458ba6495b8763dcd040c
        
    
    Parameter requirements are different for each API function. Visit the Parameter section of each object page to understand what it takes to make a request.
